# Tic Tac Toe
Implementing the classic game of Tic Tac Toe or Knotts and Crosses. I've implemented the perfect AI using minimax algorithm to search all possible game states and determine the most succesful move. To speed up the minimax algoritm I've implemented Alpha-Beta pruning, thus reducing the number of game states that need to be generated.
