# Tic Tac Toe
Implementing the classic game of Tic Tac Toe or Knotts and Crosses. You can play this game against a friend or against the computer. I've implemented the perfect AI using minimax algorithm to search all possible game states and determine the most succesful move for the computer. To speed up the minimax algoritm I've implemented Alpha-Beta pruning, thus reducing the number of game states that need to be generated. 

# Requirements
Python 3
